Understanding a COMPUTATIONAL Problem:


PROBLEM:
Given your birthday and the current date,
calculate your age in days.


**

Problem is defined by
  possible inputs(set)
  relationship between inputs -> desired outputs


SOLUTION:
  input -> Procedure -> output


STEPS TO SOLVING ALL PROBLEMS:

** First: What are the inputs?
  Your birthday & current date. (Two Dates)

  What is the set of valid inputs? (Defensive Programming)
  - Second date must NOT be before
    first date.
  - Gregorian calendar started 15 Oct 1582
    (for dealing with range of dates)


  How are inputs represented?

  def daysBetweenDates(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):



** Second: What are the the outputs?
  Calculate your age in days.



** Third: Solve the problem!
