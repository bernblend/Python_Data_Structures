Understanding a COMPUTATIONAL Problem:

NOTE:
Processor can do about a billion instructions per second
(which is roughly 1 nanosecond per instruction).


PROBLEM:
Given your birthday and the current date,
calculate your age in days.


**

Problem is defined by
  possible inputs(set)
  relationship between inputs -> desired outputs


SOLUTION:
  input -> Procedure -> output


STEPS TO SOLVING ALL PROBLEMS:

** First: What are the inputs?
  Your birthday & current date. (Two Dates)

  What is the set of valid inputs? (Defensive Programming)
  - Second date must NOT be before
    first date.
  - Gregorian calendar started 15 Oct 1582
    (for dealing with range of dates)


  How are inputs represented?

  def daysBetweenDates(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):



** Second: What are the the outputs?
  Calculate your age in days.



** Third: Solve the problem!





** Let's try an example:

  def daysBetweenDates(2013, 1, 24, 2013, 6, 29):
    Jan 24-31 = 7
   +Feb        28
   +March      31
   +April      30
   +May        31
   +June 1-29  29

      Total:   156


If the current year were to be 2024, now we would
need to look at some years like 2013 having 365 days
and 2024 having 366 days.



ALGORITHM: 'pseudocode'

  days = # of days in month1 - day1    // ex: (31 - 24 = 7)
  month1++                           //  go to next month
  while month1 < month2:
    days += # of days in month1
    month1++
  days += day2
  while year1 < year2:
    days += days in year1


**** The ALGORITHM above is NO GOOD
as it has a lot of steps and has
inputs that it can't handle:
  - input dates in same month
  - month2 < month1
  - counting days in leap years
