Structured Data:


We have functioned with the 'string' data type.
    - A series of characters inside of quotation marks.


Now we look at the 'list' data type:
    - Elements can be string, int, or another 'list'.
    - Placed in brackets [ ] separated by commas.



Mutation:
  - Lists support Mutation. This means we can change the
  value of a list after it's created.

  - s = 'Yello'
    s = s + 'w'
    The above does NOT modify the current string but instead
    creates a new list.
    OUTPUT: YELLOW
    and 's' refers to this new string.
